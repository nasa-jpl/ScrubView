# Overview
ScrubView allows developers to review and disposition results from static analyzers. ScrubView imports static analysis results using the SARIF format. Any tool that is capable of exporting results in the SARIF format can easily be ingested into ScrubView for display and review.

ScrubView is built on the Node.js and Electron platforms and is a combination of HTML / CSS, Javascript and Typescript. It is multiplatform, and will run on MacOS, Windows, and Linux platforms. 

Though not explicitly required, ScrubView is intended to be paired with [SCRUB](https://github.com/nasa/scrub) to provide the most streamlined experience.
